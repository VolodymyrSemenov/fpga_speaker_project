2. REPORT DETAILS

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mic_codec/p_0_in[11] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mic_codec/rx_data_reg[11]_i_1/O, cell mic_codec/rx_data_reg[11]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mic_codec/p_0_in[13] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mic_codec/rx_data_reg[13]_i_1/O, cell mic_codec/rx_data_reg[13]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
