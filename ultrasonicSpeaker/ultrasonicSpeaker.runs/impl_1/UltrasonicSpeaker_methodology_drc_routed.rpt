2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-20#1 Warning

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch mic_codec/rx_data_reg[19] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin mic_codec/rx_data_reg[19]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

Non-clocked latch  
The latch mic_codec/rx_data_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin mic_codec/rx_data_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch mic_codec/rx_data_reg[21] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin mic_codec/rx_data_reg[21]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch mic_codec/rx_data_reg[23] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin mic_codec/rx_data_reg[23]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 8.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: C:/Users/semenov/Desktop/speaker_project/ultrasonicSpeaker/ultrasonicSpeaker.srcs/constrs_1/new/constraints.xdc (Line: 1))
Previous: create_clock -period 8.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: c:/Users/semenov/Desktop/speaker_project/ultrasonicSpeaker/ultrasonicSpeaker.gen/sources_1/ip/combined_clock_gen/combined_clock_gen.xdc (Line: 53))
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 8.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: C:/Users/semenov/Desktop/speaker_project/ultrasonicSpeaker/ultrasonicSpeaker.srcs/constrs_1/new/constraints.xdc (Line: 1))
Previous: create_clock -period 8.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: c:/Users/semenov/Desktop/speaker_project/ultrasonicSpeaker/ultrasonicSpeaker.gen/sources_1/ip/combined_clock_gen/combined_clock_gen.xdc (Line: 53))
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 12 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
