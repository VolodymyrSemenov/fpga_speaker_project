XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 8.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: C:/Users/semenov/Desktop/speaker_project/ultrasonicSpeaker/ultrasonicSpeaker.srcs/constrs_1/new/constraints.xdc (Line: 1))
Previous: create_clock -period 8.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: c:/Users/semenov/Desktop/speaker_project/ultrasonicSpeaker/ultrasonicSpeaker.gen/sources_1/ip/combined_clock_gen/combined_clock_gen.xdc (Line: 53))
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 8.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: C:/Users/semenov/Desktop/speaker_project/ultrasonicSpeaker/ultrasonicSpeaker.srcs/constrs_1/new/constraints.xdc (Line: 1))

Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 20 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
