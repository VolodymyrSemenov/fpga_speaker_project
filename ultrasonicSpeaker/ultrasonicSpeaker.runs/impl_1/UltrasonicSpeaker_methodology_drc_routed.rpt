2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.914 ns between something_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_out1_combined_clock_gen) and test_reg[11]/D (clocked by clk_out2_combined_clock_gen). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -7.087 ns between something_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_out1_combined_clock_gen) and test_reg[10]/D (clocked by clk_out2_combined_clock_gen). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 8.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: C:/Users/semenov/Desktop/speaker_project/ultrasonicSpeaker/ultrasonicSpeaker.srcs/constrs_1/new/constraints.xdc (Line: 1))
Previous: create_clock -period 8.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: c:/Users/semenov/Desktop/speaker_project/ultrasonicSpeaker/ultrasonicSpeaker.gen/sources_1/ip/combined_clock_gen/combined_clock_gen.xdc (Line: 53))
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 8.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: C:/Users/semenov/Desktop/speaker_project/ultrasonicSpeaker/ultrasonicSpeaker.srcs/constrs_1/new/constraints.xdc (Line: 1))
Previous: create_clock -period 8.000 [get_ports clk] (Source: c:/Users/semenov/Desktop/speaker_project/ultrasonicSpeaker/ultrasonicSpeaker.gen/sources_1/ip/combined_clock_gen/combined_clock_gen.xdc (Line: 53))
